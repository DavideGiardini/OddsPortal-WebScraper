In the last year of my University Degree in "Statistical Sciences of Economy and Business" I had the pleasure to help one of my uni friends in the writing of his Thesis.
As he had a very deep passion for sports, he decided to merge his hobby with statistics. Fortunately for him, sport and statistics are in fact very close to each other, especially in the field of betting. </br>
What he wanted to do was trying to **evaluate the odds' precision**. The way he intended to do it was by comparing Asian Handicaps and Over/Unders used before the match for bets with the final result of the match itself.

> ### Asian Handicap
> Asian handicap betting is a form of betting in which teams are handicapped according to their form so that a stronger team must win by more points for a bet on them to win.

> ### Over/Under
> The over/under predicts the combined score of the two teams. Then, the bettors will bet if the combined score would be either more than or less than that number.

For every match, every possible score of both the AH and the O/U is given two odds, one represents the probability that the real AH or O/U will be lower, the other represents the probability that the two will be higher. In this way, the Asian Handicap or the Over/Under for which the two odds are equal (or very near to one another) is the one that the betting market predicts as more probable.<br>
<br>
I'll give you an example:<br>

</p>
In this Finals' match betweet Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics, the two odds reach the same value (1.90) at the AH -3.5. This means that, for the betting market, it is equally probable that the final score will be more than 3.5 points in favor of GSW or less than 3.5 points in favor of GSW, that is to say that the betting market best prediction is that GSW will win with 3.5 points.<br>
